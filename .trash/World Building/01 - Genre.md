I am thinking that the genre is fantasy but the locale is local. Maybe a big city like Boston, or maybe Nashua or Manchester.  Ooooh, I like the idea of Nashua.  I will needs some Nashua maps. I can imagine walking downtown, which is usually bustling, with no moving cars, plants breaking through the pavement, maybe to stores, etc, used as nests or burrows.
