#### About Today
---
Today is halloween but I will not be participating in any way. My back hurts and it hurts to squat. I am starting to feel old and it sucks.  The good news is that I am making more progress in the basement and I did 10 more sticks today so that is now off my list. I may add it back on come spring but not right now.  I doubt I will do any Blender for now, either. I hate sitting in my chair. It is not uncomfortable but I still hate it.   I have a lot more to clean up and every little bit of progress brings me closer to where I want to be. I will start some laundry in a bit and get some other stuff done but we will see what I do with the rest of my day.
