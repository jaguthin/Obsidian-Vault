#### About Today
---

I did the cheese tutorial in blender yesterday and made some cheese. it was  not perfect as I made a few mistakes but it was not terrible.  Next I will do a donut tutorial today. I have already watched it and there are a few things I will learn that I did not before but when I do it tonight, it should work out very well. I also need to drop that thing off for Andy , as well. I went backk to do the donut but still could not figure out a few things. Perhaps it is the difference in blender, perhaps it is accent. Either way, I was not able to see how the icing was applied, but I will try again.
