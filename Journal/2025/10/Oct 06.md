#### About Today
---

Lit up a torch in Blender today. I did not do it but I was able to see what he was doing. As my walls and pillars did not line up right, I am thinking may need to do this lesson again in order to make it happen. I did see all that he did, though, and feel I know what to do to fix it but I may have to start over and recreate the pillars. We will see.  I am going to the hospital today.  I am being checked so they can fix my breathing, hopefully, so I can sleep better at night.
