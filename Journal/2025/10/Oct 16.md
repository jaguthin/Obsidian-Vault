#### About Today
---
At work today, I hope to finish the phones, at least this part. I also want to continue what I have been doing regarding the updates.   I think I am done with all else I need to do, right now, but I may persist. Especially I have to look at the fans in the KVM. Today, I watched the blender video about creating and animating drawers.  Animation is a lot easier than I thought. I will do that tonight, I hope. If there is no time, I will finish it tomorrow.  Tonight will be pretty busy so I do not want to over stress myself. Food next and then a shower and get ready for work. 160 Sticks have been cleaned up and the phones are now working at work.
