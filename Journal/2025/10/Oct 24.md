---
I went back into the chair blender project and created the lamp and some lights. I then rendered the image and liked it, for the most part. I think I understand how to do all the basics now, but we will see. I have create a list of things I want to try to make in Blender and we will see how it all goes. 240 sticks have been picked up out of the yard.
