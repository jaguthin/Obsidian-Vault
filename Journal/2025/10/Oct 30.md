#### About Today
---

Tomorrow will be Halloween.  I brought some more primer cans down to the basement and plan to continue cleaning up the house so I will likely not be doing any blender until I am all set with that. I am already overwhelmed so I really do not want to add even more.   I suspect I will get the house done over the weekend and maybe I can make a good dent in the garage, too.  Last night I thought of Jon's TV. Maybe I should test it to see if it works and if not, chuck it. If it does, take it out of the garage and find a better place to keep it. 
I will get stick soon and will have done over 300. Tomorrow is the last time and then I will take that off of my calendar which will give me less to worry about. Maybe with that gone and the house reorganized I should have more time to do blender and to work on my hobbies.  One thing I have learned, though, space is more important to me than money. Having a place for things is ultimately important. Not needing to spend money is good, but it is not as high on importance as having space.
