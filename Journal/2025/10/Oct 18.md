#### About Today
---
I went to the No Kings rally in Milford. Though I did not talk to anyone the support was incredible. The feeling was incredible.   I am very glad I went.  As of today, there have been 180 sticks removed from the yard. I will continue this until the end of the month then start again in April or May. If Chase actually gets it done downstairs tomorrow, I can finally start moving stuff around and get back the garage and the shed.  Emptying the shed makes more sense, though, so I can keep it empty for Chase to fix.  He will also put a new set of pull down steps for the attic but I doubt that will get done tomorrow as I have not been asked to buy any yet. In Blender today I had to make a flower pot.  I think I mostly understand what I had to do.
