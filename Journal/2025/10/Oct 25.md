#### About Today
---

Today was very productive. I did not do any hands on with Blender but I did watch a video. I ordered something from Home Depot and picked it up.  I got a bunch of things at Walmart but also did a lot here. I finished putting 4 bookshelves together. I have to finish the last two but they are put together. It is really just to screw in a few things and then they are done. Tomorrow I hope to bind all the shelves together and maybe get the black one out of my room finally. The bear that I have made for Survival of the Fattest is almost done.  I think I just need to redo his claws and maybe finish his eye. We will see. I also did  a little on the coffee house project. I hope to get a lot more done tomorrow.  I got stick removed from the yard, which makes 250 at least.  Six more days of this. 
I am not sure what else there is to write about. I did get a lot done today, though.
