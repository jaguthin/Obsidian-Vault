#### About Today
---

Allison is 26 today. It is also Jenn's birthday. She is 49 today and Jeanne is 54.  Had I not been stupid we would still be together and celebrating almost 40 years.  That is my fault and I accept responsibility. She could have talked to me but I doubt I would have heard her. i would have just taken it as criticism.  Due to that breakup, Jon, Allison and Indhira are all here and I am so very glad that they are.  Very glad. Even though I am alone right now, I have learned some valuable lessons.  Right now, I find myself most attracted to Jia even though she is almost 23 years younger than I am.   But, she is a good looking woman and she is smart and responsible. I do not know. It does not feel right in some ways but it does in others, so I guess we will see.  As of today I have cleaned 120 sticks out of the yard. If I keep that up until the end of the month it will be 310.  I am sure there are way more than that but that is a good amount.  I watched a you tube about learning blender and it made sense. I am not sure doing all the lessons helps if I do not know what I want to do. But, I think that I do know. I think that what I want to do is make 3-D versions of all the modules that I remember ( starting with Ravenloft ) and make them so I can walk through them.  I will start with something fairly simple I will do The Created and then we will see. Ultimately, it would be cool to make Ravenloft and also the surrounding country of Barovia. Putting it all together eventually would make the most sense so we will see how it goes.
