#### About Today
---
With any luck, I will continue my education tonight in Blender.   I hope to finish the chair scene that I have, but we will see. I am not going to do the blender stuff today. I am overwhelmed with so much to do. I did, however, get the stuff cut out in my current project . I hope to have it finished this week.  After this youtube live chat I will read and get closer to having that book done. I have a bear for Survival of the Fattest almost done and one of the bunnies looks good.  The basement is close and I can start putting the shelving up.
