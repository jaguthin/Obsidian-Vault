#### About Today
---

Today I started to build a living room in Blender. I have learned a lot but I really hate listening to the voice of the woman giving the lessons nor can I keep up all the time. However, If I can just bring it down into smaller pieces, it looks to work. I still hate listening to her voice, though. Once I go out and get the sticks done, there will be 190 done.
