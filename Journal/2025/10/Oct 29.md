#### About Today
---

I have not written here fora  bit but I have had other things to focus on. Mostly, the basement is almost done and is at a place where I can do stuff. I spent the weekend putting bookshelves together and installing shelving on the walls.  I finish it Monday then Tuesday morning and night I fastened it all.  I did not do any blender during this time but likely will soon. My bedroom is cleaned out and only has what I want in it.  Next will be the living room, etc, but I will wait until Chase finishes up before I bond the shelves together and mount them to the wall for anti-tipping.  It feels so good to do that. I emptied off the black shelf and put it downstairs. I then emptied off my bookshelf in my closet and pulled that out and repopulated it.  I move my shoe rack to the other side and will look into replacing the doors on the closet soon. I need to do that and the door to the bathroom.   As of today, I picked up 290 sticks and threw them into the woods. I am sure it is more than that.  I also have an insurance bill but may be able to use my HSA to pay it off if that happens soon.  That is all I have, I think.   At least that is all for now. I guess I should mention that I got the longer screws in today so I put the last of the outlet covers up.  I got the stuff to redo the TV and internet next.   I am not sure, yet, if I will keep my wifi device. If I do, I need to wipe it as I do not remember the password to access it.
