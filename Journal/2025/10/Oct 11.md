#### About Today
---
Allison will be 26 tomorrow. My kids are getting older. My son is older now than I was when he was born.  Almost a year has gone by without him, already.  I am tired. I am going to finish the book and get some other stuff done around the house.  Today in blender was about making a sword.  Grant Abbitt know what he is doing but it seems to go to fast for me sometimes.  I wonder if he is really the right person to learn from.  Who knows.  I do not really understand a few things.
