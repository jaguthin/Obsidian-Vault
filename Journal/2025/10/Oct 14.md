#### About Today
---
Yesterday I did the Brad Colbow blender tutorial. Actually, I had watched it the other day and tried to recreate it yesterday. I did most of it without issue but I had the boolean cutout stuff wrong.  Also, when I render the wheels are not where I have them in the picture. I do not know why.   Other than that, though, I seem to have a good grasp of the basics. Grant Abbit is a good blender person but goes a bit too fast for me to keep up with him. I found some other basic tutorial that I plan to do. I also feel like I learned some stuff better from the Brad Colbow tutorial. I think I understand mirrors better. There is an array modifier, stuff like that.
