#### About Today
---
Today in Unity was the start of loops. Loops are nothing new to me in programming but it is nice to start that here.  Also, yesterday I finally learned that I like scripting and programming for the sake of itself. I used to think I liked it due to the result but the result was just proof that what I was doing was working. I also started Tai Chi and am talking to a woman from Senegal named Tessy. She is gorgeous and we will see how this goes.
