#### About Today
---
Today was good. I did some more Blender which went over the viewport and rendering. I also hookup up the little monitor. The power and the extra screen are coming from my computer right now but I may change that. It works for now, though.  Today is also the last day of the month. Tomorrow starts September and things will start to get cold again.  I also need to finish a few books today.  I plan to go for a walk, as well.
