#### About Today
---

Today in the unity lesson we did the final Balloon Pop stuff which was to tie score to the on screen text. I then took a test and got 75% on it.   I did some rust yesterday, too. I have learned that I like coding. Doing ansible and bash and stuff like that was not really about automation. I do like to see that but it was really about getting my code to work right.
