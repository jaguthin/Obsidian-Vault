#### About Today
---
Today's Unity lesson was confusing. I may not have the right version or settings so I need to try again. 
I finally figured out the issue and returned.  After building my game it would not run unless I copied everything into another folder.  Is it possible to do a standalone game? I also took a quiz and got 100% on it.
