#### About Today
---
I finished Venco today.  I managed to get three loads of boxes and other trash to the recycling center. I moved the leftover flooring to the small shed. I blew leaves in the driveway but the battery ran out so I did not finish. It does look a lot better, though. I may have figured out what has been causing the freeze up with cinnamon.  I removed the weather desklet have not had any freeze ups yet. We will see how that goes. I need go back downstairs and do some more cleaning but my back was hurting so I am going to take a break. There is still a lot down there that I need to move out of the way but I do not have to do it right now.   Maybe I will even go back out and do more leaves out of the driveway since it is so dry to day. But we will see. I hope to restart my blender learning on Monday. 

We will see where I am.
