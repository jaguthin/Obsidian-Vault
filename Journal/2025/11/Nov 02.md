#### About Today
---
One of these days, I will plan to do nothing on a weekend. I have surgery coming up, so that may be the best time. For now, I have been making a lot of progress toward getting stuff put away down stairs.  I hope do more of that as time goes on. Right now, though, what I want most is just to get the stuff that is down there put away and get back my counters so I can move on with the next thing. My game boxes are too big for the shelves I bought.  I sort of wish I had been more careful but then, maybe it will not be so bad once I am done.  

There is already a lot of room and I may do the small shed next and get that all figured out before I start on the garage. As it is, it is starting to look like I am going to have to wait until Spring to get the dumpster.  There will be a lot of trash and I want to get it all at the same time.   After I have finally cleaned up the garage, etc, it should be easy to just get it all done in a weekend.
