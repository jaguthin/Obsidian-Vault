#### About Today
---

I did another lesson in Polygon Runway today. It was stuff I knew how to do and have done before but I wanted to work with the tutorial.  I have already taken Jon's TV out and the mount and also brought two chair in from the garage. I also shut the garage door so I hope to have that done soon.  I am hoping to close on the loan this week so I can get everything paid for and then put the rest into a "Jon" fund.  I figure if I pay it down over the next 5 years and manage to throw an extra 550/mo at least, I will have paid off an extra 30K beyond the normal payment and then I may be able to do a new loan from 401K to pay it off.  Then, I will have to pay back to me, only, I will have almost 300K in my 401K by then so If plan to just do 10 more years not only will I have almost 400K in my 401K but I will be debt free at the end of it.   I set up the new infuser in my bedroom and finished King Sorrow yesterday. I am reading The Weight of Blood right now. I do not expect Chase to show up today but you never know.  We will see.
