#### About Today
---
I will get back to Blender very soon. I have built a new thing for coffee and hot water. I am hoping I can empty off the shelf in front of the lamp but we will see.  That has been done. The new corner shelf has been put up in the media room as has the new cord been run and covered. I am thinking about mounting the new Ethernet cable up to the wall but have not do that yet.  Hmm. Maybe I can just use the cable ties I got and connect to the cables that are already run rather than put up something new. I do, however, want them to look neat so we will see.  We saw Jon yesterday for over 3 hours. It is hard to imagine that he has been incarcerated for almost a year. I have surgery coming up in a few weeks and have been asked to spend a week in recovery. I am not sure I can do that but if I feel up to it, maybe I can do 4 hours of work for the last few days. There is an end of year shutdown coming so I need time for that, too.  It is looking like 11 days and I will have to cover 5 of them. 1 can be done with Floating Holiday time coming up and the rest I should be able to with the PTO I have. I guess wee will see. Back to Band of Brothers and my book.  I just noticed that the Heat Map is not working for the older stuff. Only today since I just reenabled it.   That sucks.  I did a highlight and it shows 388  words so the heatmap is useless.
