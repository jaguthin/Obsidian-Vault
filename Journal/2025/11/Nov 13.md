#### About Today
---

I am trying to keep up with this. Today , well every day really, but today has reinforced how much I make up for the inequities of others. When Nick did an upgrade last night, it was me who fixed most the issues. I should not have but it bothers me to see issues on the dashboard that I can fix.  So, I fixed them. I got notified about another issue that I have asked to be looked at several times but has not been. Perhaps I have not communicated properly so I will try to change how I communicate. I will be more active and will make a note to follow up.  Then when others expect the change but I have not yet been told to make the change, I will not.  I did get some stuff out of the big shed and will do more tomorrow and over the weekend. Four hand fulls did a lot but there is still so much more to do and I have already started to fill up the new hobby area. Perhaps, after tomorrow, it would make sense for me to get downstairs cleaned up, first, before I add any more.   It may even make sense to clean up duplicates and get that stuff moved out of the way.  Saturday I plan to get rid of all the cardboard which should open up the garage by quite a lot. If I do the same thing with Jon's old futon, then I should really get a lot of room. Perhaps I can use the small shed for putting even more of Jon's stuff, especially the stuff that will not go under the stairs easily. 

With any luck, I will be in a very good place by Sunday. We will see.
