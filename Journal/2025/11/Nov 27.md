---

Today is Thanksgiving.   I am cooking a ham but it is quiet today. Indhira is working until 2. We will eat after four. Around four it when I plan to make the rest of the stuff. Yams, stuffing, cranberry sauce, etc.. I read a few more chapters of King Sorrow and hope to have that done by Monday. Hopefully before.
