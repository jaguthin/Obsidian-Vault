#### About Today
---
I do not think things will Albina are going to progress. She has changed since I mentioned needing to report that I know her. I can't even get her full name.  I have started talking to Dorcas again, so we will see how that goes. That said, as much as I would love to get involved with someone in a physical way, I do not see how anything can really happen right now.
I did, however, get more of the garage done today. I was able to clean up the area where all the spare wood was. I would like to really clean that up but for now, it is much nicer and I can sweep over there. Granted, a lot of it it stuff I need to toss but that will happen.
