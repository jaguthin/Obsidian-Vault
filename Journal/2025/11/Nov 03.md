#### About Today
---
I have spent a lot of money this month but I do not regret it. All that I have spent is for the betterment of this house.  I brought two boxes of stuff in from the shed today and cleaned them out. There were a lot of brushes and air brushes and I saw a lot of paint in there, too so I will need to deal with that.  A lot of the paint can just be put up and out of the way. With any luck, I will be done with the small shed this week and then I  can do a combination of the garage and the big shed to finish up.  We will see how it goes. It is getting colder and colder so I may wait but I can be stubborn so we will see.
