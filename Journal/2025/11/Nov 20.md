#### About Today
---
It looks like whatever was going to happen with Albina is over. She went ghost and I have heard nothing from her since Tuesday. Yesterday, Dorcas asked me for money and I barely know her, so that is a huge red flag. There have been a lot of red flags anyway, but that added to it. I worked in the Garage today. I did some sweeping but do not really feel  like I can go forward until I get the new trash out of there. So until that happens, I will pull stuff out of the shed.   I hope we can get that fixed soon. As I can take all the survival stuff out of the basement and put it in the shed and then have the empty shelves for models if I need it.  Blender 5.0 came out and is downloaded, so I will be starting work on that very soon.
