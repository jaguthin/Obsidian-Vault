#### About Today
---
I spent more time in the garage today.  I think I know what I will focus on tomorrow but I did get Jon's TV out of there. I will test it soon.  We really are getting down to where there is not a lot left.   I will play a lot of Tetris but even the Jon stuff is not as much as it once was. Tomorrow, I see another box of stuff that is his that could be packed but there  is not a lot. If his TV works, I will put that under the stairs, too.  I plan to also pick up more garbage in the garage and then get rid of it this weekend.   With any luck, I should have a fairly clean garage this weekend. We will see. 

I need Chase to quote me on a few more things. All is almost done in the basement.  I would like a quote for fixing the shed and a quote for railings. Outside and inside and then maybe the stairs and possibly painting the entrance way. Then I could put up pictures.   We will see, though. 

Regarding Blender. I do want to do that but think I may have to wait another week or so before I start that.
