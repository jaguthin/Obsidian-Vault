#### About Today
---
Tomorrow is Veteran's Day.   We  have a get together in Burlington at noon but it is not a full day and we will get paid for it.   Beyond that, there is nothing to write about.  I did work in the garage for 10 minutes this morning, though, and managed to get one box mostly cleaned out but did make a decent dent in what needs doing. 
More tomorrow and the other shed as well.
