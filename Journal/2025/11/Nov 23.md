#### About Today
---
Today has been pretty productive.  I managed to get a lot of the garage done and also blew a bunch of leaves out of the driveway. There is more, of course, but it looks so much better than it did. I expect the garage to be very clean soon. Today I got rid of the pallet we were using. I put all the tools together. I did a bit of sweeping.  The garage  is almost there. It may even be done this week or by this weekend, at least. It is not looking like we are going to do anything with the shed until Spring or the other stuff that I would like Chase to do, but the basement is huge.  Soon, we can start pulling stuff out of the Attic to be cataloged and sorted. I want to know all that is up in the Attic  should we need to get anything.  I hope to start Blender again tomorrow, but we will see.
