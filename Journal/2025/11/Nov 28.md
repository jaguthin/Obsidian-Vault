#### About Today
---
Today is the day after thanksgiving. Almost all the Ham has been save and I threw the rest away yesterday.  I am nearly ready to start on Blender again.  I have verified that what I have see on the video I downloaded is the same as what is on youtube. I  am almost done with King Sorrow and expect to be finished soon. Maybe not tonight but soon. Tomorrow at the latest.
