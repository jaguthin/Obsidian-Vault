#### About Today
---
The weekend again. Two days to get some stuff going and then back to work. At some point, I hope to have very little to do on the weekends so I can just relax and read or whatever.   I am feeling old and doing all this is exhausting.  I plan to get a bunch of stuff out of the garage so I can clean up in there a lot more.  That and a few other things that I may or may not do. We will see.

I am tired.
