#### About Today
---
Igho got in touch with me today on IC.  I am not sure how I feel about her. She has a bit of a lazy eyed look and does not look attractive in the normal sense but there is something about her.  She also puts her weight at 198 so that does not work for me, but again, who knows. 

I did get some more stuff moved out of the small shed today. I need to figure out what is next. I will continue to do that shed, though, and then start on the stuff in the garage, I think. I a lot will go in the attic and I plan to catalog  it.
