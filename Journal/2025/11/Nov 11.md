#### About Today
---
Aquila had a Veteran's Day get together today. I got a $10.00 gift card for Dunkin' Donuts which I will send to Allie.  We also got some swag. We got a new backpack, a shirt and a cup. I should be able to use all three.  Beyond that, today has been fairly laid back. Tomorrow I will attempt to make a dent in the part of the garage where all the cds, etc, are.  If I can start to open the right side of my garage, I may be able to finally clean up the work bench, etc.. 

I have also proven that it is Cinnamon that is making my computer freeze up. So, just changed to software rendering mode. I do not see a difference so if this keep working, I will keep it. 

I guess it is time to go back to Band of Brothers and maybe my book.  I am too tired to do much else.
