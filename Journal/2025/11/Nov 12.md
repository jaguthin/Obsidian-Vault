#### About Today
---

So, not a lot to report today. I have already meditated and am about to go empty the heater bucket. I will wfh for the first part of the day but then head it after our meeting so I will not leave here until 10. When I get in, I expect to go straight upstairs to migrate some of the machines that need migrating and potentially start another sync of nfs data so we can get rid of the netapp in the next few days and then follow up with the tegile stuff. Most of the stuff has been synced off of the tegile ( the vms and datastores, anyway ) but then I will do the next bit. 

More work to do in the garage too, but I have a plan of what I want to tackle. I think the hardest part right now, is lack of space because of all the trash. Once all the trash is out of there, though, we should be able to move along pretty fast.  This weekend will be about getting the trash removed.
