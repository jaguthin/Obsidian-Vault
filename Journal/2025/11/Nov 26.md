#### About Today
---

I ended my "relationship" with Precious. I found I was not looking forward to talking to her and she was a bit of a control freak. She also told me that she loves me and she completely forgot us talking one time because she was drunk.   I do not know if I feel bad or not. I started the Blender tutorial video and also saw how long it would take to cook the ham. So, if I toss it in the slow cooker around 11 we can eat around four. Today also starts my "time off" though, I will have to get some time in because I do not have enough PTO to cover this and the end of year shut down.
