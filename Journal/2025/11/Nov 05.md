#### About Today
---
it is almost payday. I expect to have some good cash in my account soon and to be paying the 401K loan soon. Every little bit lower will just make thing easier.  If that loan allows me to consolidate the current HELOC and the car at a lower rate, that would be most awesome.  
I got some more stuff pulled out of the small shed today. I hope to have it fully emptied by this weekend. We will see. There are only 4 more boxes but there is paint and other stuff that I will need to look at. Next the garage and the big shed.  

Also, if I were to consolidate I could likely make the payment a lot easier as I could take the old car payment and add it to the new loan so I can pay things down even easier then next year, I can get a 401K loan to pay off the AC and maybe the current 401K loan. We will see how that goes. 

I hope to get back to the blender stuff soon.
