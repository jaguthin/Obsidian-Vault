#### About Today
---
Today blender talked about applying materials. It was a little different than what he showed but I was able to make it work.  Tomorrow is array modifiers.  I think I like this class better than the Grant Abbit stuff. But I may do that, anyway. What I want to do is learn how to make rounded areas.   Also, surgery was supposed to be today but it did not go well. We will see when it will happen next time.
