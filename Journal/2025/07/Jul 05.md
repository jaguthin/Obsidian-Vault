#### About Today
---
It is a good thing. I did 3 gratitudes again today and I hope to write every day. Not just here but to also write in my RPG world and stories, etc... I need to check out the plugins that I have for them. I will do that now. I just enabled the plugins so I can start keeping track of all the stuff. Today is kind of relaxed but I want to take a shower and cut the lines from my ship. I ordered some new line so I can finish the ship but that will not happen today. If all goes well, I will finish the Wendigo this weekend so I can work on Lady Death but I do not want to stress too much about actually finishing the Wendigo. I would rather look at it with a critical eye and do more if I need to. The fake snow will be in today and I've identified a place where I can put some fake moss or something.  I guess getting the colors down in more important than anything. I like having the writing heat map where I can see it but I do not know if it will be a good idea to embed it into my daily writing. Probably not a good idea at all. 

I  have over half the words that I wanted to do today.  I have set up the Threa folder and the Writing folders to start with. Linh wants to talk every day and improve her English. It looks like I am going to learn Vietnamese, too. I need to set a good. Maybe 5 words per day will give me 1825 words in a year.  Perhaps will make sense to get to 100 or 500 and stop for a bit.  The idea is to learn a little and get good enough with it before I move on. I should do the same with German. I need to watch that youtube video with the German words. Think it is is 100.  I will make a note. 

Okay. I have made a new to-do item to learn five new words in whatever language I am focusing on and learning how to use them. Five may not be much at first but after a few days I will be able to string them together to make sentences. How did the saying go. "Shakespeare did not know more words, just more idioms." Idioms are just how you string words together. Knowing more and better ways to do that give one a more powerful sentence structure and that person can say more.
