#### About Today
---
It is almost time to start work so I will not write much right now but will do so later. I have not walked today as it is raining but I hope to do so a bit later.  When I slept last night my  jaw did not crunch, so that is a good thing. I am tired and would like a nap.  Maybe I will not start work at 9 but will start at 10 instead. We will see.

I have been going nuts on education, though, so that is a good thing. I have been working on learning godot. Even though it is a game engine, I am sure I could use it for other stuff. Even just a demo or even a self contained world should work okay with it. 

I still have not been charged for the tow of the Maxima.  I have to scan the receipt from VIP and add it to my electronic stuff so I do not need to use space with the papers.  I will do that and also hope to clean off my desk today.   We will see. I do not look to be seeing very well but do hope to get that done as well as some stuff for Jon. I spoke to Jon yesterday and we were both complaining.  He is very homesick and I miss the hell out of him. I am glad that the basement is finally getting done but I wish there was another way. I have not seen him in person since December and I will never forget it.   He was angry. He was angry at Julia and I do not blame him. She used him and now he is paying the penalty. He was not in a place where he could see what she was doing but now, with hind sight, he is seeing it.  

Linh and I are not talking much so I assume that relationship will just peter out, which is okay by me. I can't help but still feel some mistrust. Maybe i should tell her more but I am still trying to figure out how  I feel.   I think I am going to go take a nap and will also do more Godot education before I start work at 10. 

I took a nap. I managed to fall asleep. I do not know how long  I was actually asleep but I will start work in a few minutes.  I am going to wfh today so I will likely do a lot of ansible clean up,  type stuff. 

I did a bit more with godot. I did a basic 3d but it looks like basic stuff  can  be done but if one wants better stuff then something like blender will need to be used.  Still I have made  some awesome progress toward the goal. I have no idea what kind of game I want to make but perhaps I can emulate another game but with my own content.
