#### About Today
---
I got a lot done today and I have an even better understanding so I can apply things tomorrow.  I am hoping to make it so I can create a vm from a template and then Ansible to get it all set up. There is a lot to do but if the nfs shares are mostly similar that will be easy to set up.  Today I got a bunch of stuff in from Amazon that I wanted for when the basement is done and I can move almost everything down there. I expect to keep some stuff up here, mostly wooden and paper crafts but the rest will go downstairs.  

I think I am going to go get something to eat. I did not write much yesterday and I do not expect to write much today, but we will see. I am feeling very hesitant about Linh now and I was feeling so into her yesterday but after the comments she made after getting off of the video call yesterday, i am feeling very skeptical. Skeptical to the point that I am not sure I want to continue down that road. What I have seen is that I have to do things a certain way in order for her to feel like I am showing care. I did that. I do not know what to feel about the fact that she does not see it.  So, maybe it is better to just let it go. I am going to go get something to drink and cook some food. 

Food is cooking. I also put down some glue and put some snow, that does not look very good, onto my wendigo base. I am going to let it dry over night and look at it tomorrow. Perhaps it will need more "snow" and I will add it if needed. I got two more kits in the mail today. One is a haunted house and the other is a tram. I also need something round so I can set up the flowers for my kit that Allie and Indhira got me for my birthday last year.   It is almost there but I do have a lot to do. I did get the door built and am working on a suitcase and a book shelf but they are not done yet. Not really. 

I think I am going to go watch more Fringe. It is not yet 8:00 and I think I will reset my alarm for 6:30 so I can get up and walk each day.
