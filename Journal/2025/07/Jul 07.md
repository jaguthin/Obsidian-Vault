#### About Today
---
Today has been good so far. I woke up an went for a walk. I did 1 1/2 miles which I still have to add to my app. I ate and got everything done on  my list.  I will do more of it soon. A lot of stuff is going to come off of my list very soon. With any luck, I will soon get to not have anything scheduled for the weekends other than my own stuff.  However, I need to go meditate right now and shower and go to work. I will write more later.
