#### About Today
---
I just went outside to get a package. A paper cutter and some black thread, that I will used for my ship,  came in. If I put that thread on the ship tomorrow, then that project will be finished. I put the fake snow on my Wendigo model the other day and it did not look good. I was able to brush it off and have a bit more to go but I did find a pot of snow texture so I will give that a go if it is not dried out. 


Mom texted about needing a ride tomorrow. Of course, she did not ask, she just said she might need one.  Why is it so hard for her to just be polite.  It is not that hard. I do it all the time.  

I went for a walk today. I did almost a mile and a half. If I do that for 180 days I will finish the Fellowship challenge but I do hope to get out the bike this weekend and get it ready.  I have not been talking to Linh much and I do not feel the desire too.  I do not know if I am being too critical but she showed me the other day what life with her would be like. She seems to be a bit of a control freak and if things do not go the way she expects, then it did not go well at all. She does not see all that is going on behind the scenes. I told her what I had done, but I should not have had to point it all out.   

What else is there to write about. Hmmm. Maybe I will go ahead and order those two books about fighting.  She goes into a lot of different things and she was a lot of fun to listen to on the Writer's Digest podcast. I am almost done with them and then they will be once a month. The python podcast is every week. I do not know if I should go back to, I have no idea what I was about to write so I will just let it be there. Uncomfortable. An elephant in the room.  

Linh is doing what she does again.  I will watch Fringe in a little bit and will clean up my desk tomorrow, hopefully. I think I am going to go order those two books. 


I did order those two books. I also ordered some glassware for storage. I rejoined prime by using a free 30 Day membership.  So it will all get delivered faster. The second book will not be here until next week but that is okay.  I will not be reading that one for a bit, any way.
