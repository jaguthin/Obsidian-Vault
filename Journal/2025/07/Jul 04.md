#### About Today
---
I think I really like this theme. As I look around at it more it looks better and better all the time. I just installed a new plugin and added it to my sidebar. It is called Keep the Rhythm and it shows how many words I typed and it also shows where. 
Yesterday I drove down to Fitchburg to John's mom's house, and without exception they looked very glad to see me. Ninny (Patty), Jen, Cassie, Nick and of course, John and Rhonda. And today Linh, from Vietnam, talked to me and it looks to be official. She and I are now in a relationship.   Only 125 word. The goal right now is 500. Perhaps I could do a string of consciousness thing. I have had idea for writing of late, so I should explore that. I have been doing too much on my laptop and that is a good distraction but that is all. I am getting the ship almost done. I was ready to give up on it but, per Jon's advice, I put it away for few days and then I went back to it. I ordered some thread today so I can finish the rigging and I had to glue a bunch of stuff together. I am waiting on some glue to dry and then I will do the final tie off until the thread comes in. 
I also made some progress on my Wendigo today. That, to me, is very important.  Once I am done with that, I can work on Lady Death, give that to Matt and the I will probably finish the tram. That will free up a lot of room and that makes me happy.  
Chase also got a lot done downstairs. The drywall is all up.  I think I may have bought more than we need but since Chase is giving me such a good deal, it is okay to let him keep it. I already transferred the cost of it over. Next he plans to mud and then paint. After that the flooring, counters and cabinets will get done. Then I will put up some shelving and when that room is done, I can empty out the garage of the models and stuff and put it all away.  He is also going to replace the attic stairs. I will pull all that I can out of the attic and try to get some real organization done.  It is getting so close. Chase pointed out something on the house today and I will need to look at that, but I need to wash the house first and empty out the gutters.  
It is getting there.
