#### About Today
---
I spent more time with Godot and my mind is starting to think of something that i can use. That said, however, it will take a bit to get there.   I can envision a world based on my D&D campaign but I do not know where I want to go with that.   

I built the Haunted House, that is, I finished it.  The tram was done yesterday. I do not feel so great so I am going to go sit down and see how I feel a bit later. Right now, though, it is just after 4.  I have to fold laundry and do a few other things, but I think I am there.
