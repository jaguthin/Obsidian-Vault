#### About Today
---
I did some more stuff in Godot. Lighting and textures. It will take some work to get comfortable with it but I expect that to come as I develop more ideas.   I sort of envision creating an unnamed rpg but Jon had a good idea yesterday.  He talked about Mythago wood and I immediately thought of how I could make a game where you need to get to Lavondyss. It seems like a neat idea but I also have to think about how I want it to look. 

I am almost done with the Tram thing I am working on.   One of the pieces when missing and other stuff full apart when I put it together but it is almost done. I hope to have it done today and then I will do the haunted house. I am making progress on the garden house and hope to put more snow down on the wendigo base today, too.   I have a lot of stuff I should do.

- [ ]  Connect base to Baba Yaga hut
- [x] Finish tram robotime model. ✅ 2025-07-11
- [x] Build Haunted house model. ✅ 2025-07-12
- [x] Add snow to the wendigo base. ✅ 2025-08-29
- [x] Finish stringing the ship model. ✅ 2025-07-13

I think that that may be all for now but it is stuff I need to do.  After I am done with it I can finally get to work on Lady Death and get her all set.  Matt K has been very patient so far and I hope to get it to him soon as that will make him very happy.   We are getting old. I can feel my back hurt all the time, and people will start dying on a regular basis. I am not a young man anymore and I want to get as much done as I can.   I have been feeling panicky the past few days and hope that that goes away soon. I have a few things I need to do today. I need to shower, brush my teeth, do my laundry, go shopping, get my meds, get gas, and a few other things but the writing is almost done.   I need to get stuff done and put it my rear view. I miss Jon. I hope Chase gets more of the basement done today and soon the basement will be usable. I look forward to getting it all set up and getting my room emptied of all the bs.  It will be nice to have room again.  I wonder if I should move my bed. If I were to put my desk under all the shelves that could be nice but I do no know if I will have the space to do that.   We will see. 

The Tram is done. The Haunted House is next. The Haunted House is close to done. I may actually finish it today. 

I am going to go watch Fringe. Only a few and then first season is done.
