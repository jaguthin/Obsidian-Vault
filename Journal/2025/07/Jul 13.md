#### About Today
---

I did  two things today.  The Rhythm plugin does not look to really keep track of what I have done today but, I forgot, I added a new page with Task Management information so it is keeping track of that. 
I almost have the snow on my Wendigo base done.  Once it is down I will sand it and then finish painting the Wendigo and attach it with super glue. When it is done I can finally work on Lady Death. Chase did not show up yesterday so the basement will have to wait. I am so excited and am chomping at the bit so I can start getting stuff moved. I look around and keep seeing things that can get moved. Perhaps some can even be removed from my Office. I see a secondary chess board, so that is a good candidate.  I wonder if it makes sense to run a new network cable so I can  move some of the electronics downstairs but it may not really make much sense. Perhaps, it will make more sense to put stuff I do not currently need  into a tub and put it up in the Attic after I inventory it.  I assume, once all is done, I will also be able to move a lot of stuff out of the shed and, potentially, consolidate the sheds.  If all goes well then I will not need to access them very often at all.  Most of the survival stuff ( which I should inventory ) will go in the main shed and then perhaps one of the other two sheds can be dismantled.  Once we can group stuff into trash, etc, it will be nice to just put it all in the dumpster and then to be able to empty out the garage and get back a lot of space. A lot of Jon's stuff can be separated.  All books and magazines can go on his bookshelf. All models into the craft area. Any letters from Jay, etc, that he may want to dispose of, can be put together. A lot of it can go under the stairs but he has stuff that can be put into small containers, too.  He seems to have a lot of USB devices.  A small plastic container can be used to gather that all up.

My new computer has not been shipped yet  It has been 10 days since I ordered it so this is taking a bit too long.  However, that said,  I should be able to consolidate again. Perhaps both of the small pcs can be removed so I will only have my main PC that I will call Ryhope most likely.  Possible MythagoWood, but we will see.   But if I were to put all on one pc and then maybe move one that is not needed regularly out of the way, that may make the most sense. 

I wonder how much, if anything, I can removed from osh?
