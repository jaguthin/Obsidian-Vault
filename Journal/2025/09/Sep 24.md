#### About Today
---
My new computer acted up again last night. I turned it off and it worked this morning but I brought out my laptop which I will likely turn back into my main computer. I do, however, like how my main pc renders images faster in blender but I can't trust it.   So in Blender I have made a few pillars and there will be more next but at least I did get it done today.
