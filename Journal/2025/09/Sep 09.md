#### About Today
---
Today in blender was about coloring the houses in the lighthouse scene. I assume the lighthouse will be very similar but there will be loop cuts to separate the colors, but we will see. I have also grabbed my python book so i can bring it to work today and figure out the debugging on the script I am writing.
