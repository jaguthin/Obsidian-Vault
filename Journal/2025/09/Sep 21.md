#### About Today
---
Today was an interesting day. I knew Traci was the love of my life but I did not know the depth of my love for her until today. We visited Pop's and Uncle Zuke's graves. I was very emotional with Pop but not so much with Uncle Zuke. That is okay. I liked Uncle Zuke and I know he liked me.   I know he did not like my Mom much and when it was just the two of us she never stopped talking. I do not know how to feel about that.  It is irritating and I lost my temper with her but, I do not know how to feel. It seem like she is not affected by my feelings at all.  I really do  not know how to feel about my mom, but you never know. Today in Blender I created a crate but we must have very different versions of blender because not all the instruction he gave worked.  He has 4.3 as do I but I do not know which version.
