#### About Today
---

Today is the last day of September. Three more months and the year is almost done. We have had Trump as president again for almost a year. He has done so much to hurt this country already that three more years will not be good.   Anyway, I did the door stuff in Blender again and I figured out what I was doing wrong.  I was extruding faces instead of edges  but it looks better. I did not do all but it looks good.
