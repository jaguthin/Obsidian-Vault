#### About Today
---

We saw Jon yesterday. It was only for a hour. When we got there we were told it would take a bit longer than usual and so we waited. I had the Hershey Squirts and spent some time in the bathroom. My underwear were a bit gross but I did what I could.  Todays I took two lessons in Blender. One of them had to do with snapping which I did not do.  The other was the decimate modifier.
