#### About Today
---
Today in blender was about adding lights to the lighthouse scene. We mimicked moonlight and added a pretend streetlight, too. I do not have as many houses as Grannt so I did not need as much lighting but I do like how the pictures is starting to look. Tomorrow should be the end of this part of the lesson. It will be fun to see what is next.
