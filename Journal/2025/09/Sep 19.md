#### About Today
---
Today in Blender ( I have not done any for a few days ) was about creating fog. I was right in how it was done, though, as I figured it would be about making a giant cube and surrounding the scene to make it happen. Tomorrow Chase is supposed to be here and plans to paint and get the flooring down. We will see how that goes. If he does, then I can actually start putting the bookshelves together downstairs.
